abstract = {We present a new constraint-based implicit active contour, which shares desirable properties of both parametric and implicit active contours. Like parametric approaches, their representation is compact and can be manipulated interactively. Like other implicit approaches, they can naturally adapt to non-simple topologies.Unlike implicit approaches using level-set methods, representation of the contour does not require a dense mesh. Instead, it is based on specified on-curve and off-curve constraints, which are interpolated using radial basis functions. These constraints are evolved according to specified forces drawn from the relevant literature of both parametric and implicit approaches.This new type of active contour is demonstrated through synthetic images, photographs, and medical images with both simple and non-simple topologies. For complex input, this approach produces results comparable to those of level set or parameterized finite-element active models, but with a compact analytic representation. As with other active contours they can also be used for tracking, especially for multiple objects that split or merge.},

abstract = {Context: Global Software Engineering (GSE) has become the predominant form of software development for global companies and has given rise to a demand for students trained in GSE. In response, universities are developing courses and curricula around GSE and researchers have begun to disseminate studies of these new approaches. Problem: GSE differs from most other computer science fields, however, in that practice is inseparable from theory. As a result, educators looking to create GSE courses face a daunting task: integrating global practice into the local classroom. Aim: This study aims to ameliorate the very difficult task of teaching GSE by delineating the challenges and providing some recommendations for overcoming them. Method: To meet our aims we pose two research questions ("When teaching GSE to students in Higher Education, what are the (a) challenges, and (b) recommendations for addressing them") and then conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to determine the answers to these questions. Our SLR follows a carefully designed and validated protocol. Results: We found 82 papers that addressed our research questions. Our findings indicate that in addition to the challenges posed by GSE in general, particular problems arise in educational situations. The majority of these challenges fall into the "global distance" category, though teamwork challenges and people issues (such as trust) also commonly arise. Organizational differences between institutions, differing skill sets between students in different locations, and varying cultural work norms, for example, all operate within educational settings in quite different ways than in professional development teams. Integrating cultural training, conducting teamwork exercises to build trust, and instructor monitoring of team communication are all examples of techniques that have been used successfully by educators according to our review Conclusion: Despite the severity of the challenges in GSE education, many institutions have successfully developed courses and curricula targeting GSE. Indeed, for each of the challenges we have identified in the literature there are numerous recommendations for overcoming them. Instructors can use the recommendations given in this study as a starting point to running successful GSE courses.},

@article{Monasor2014a,
abstract = {Context: One of the chief challenges of Global Software Development (GSD) is for globally, culturally and linguistically diverse team members to communicate effectively. Failing to meet this challenge can lead to misunderstandings that impede project success. To prepare practitioners for remote and diverse forms of communication we have developed VENTURE: a simulationbased training platform that aims to increase cultural awareness. Aim of study: Having developed a prototype training platform, we now assess whether VENTURE can deliver real learning and increase cultural awareness. Method: A survey was designed based on educational theory. Using a heuristic evaluation approach, a group of potential users trialed the system and completed a proof of learning survey before and after using the platform. Survey results, and VENTURE's own automated assessment scores, were analysed and compared. Results: Results indicate that the platform has the potential to provide useful and meaningful training for cultural awareness in GSD. A secondary result is that the assessment scheme proved useful in providing both evidence of learning and highlighting areas where VENTURE could be improved. Conclusion: Researchers and practitioners can gain an understanding of how to evaluate, train and measure soft skills, such as communication, important to all forms of software development. The methodology applied served to adapt the environment to the needs of potential users and the actual problems of GSD. Copyright 2014 ACM.},
