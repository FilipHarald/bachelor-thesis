abstract = {The emerging trend of social information processing has resulted in Web users' increased reliance on user-generated content contributed by others for information searching and decision making. Rating scores, a form of user-generated content contributed by reviewers in online rating systems, allow users to leverage others' opinions in the evaluation of objects. In this article, we focus on the problem of summarizing the rating scores given to an object into an overall score that reflects the object's quality. We observe that the existing approaches for summarizing scores largely ignores the effect of reviewers exercising different standards in assigning scores. Instead of treating all reviewers as equals, our approach models the leniency of reviewers, which refers to the tendency of a reviewer to assign higher scores than other coreviewers. Our approach is underlined by two insights: (1) The leniency of a reviewer depends not only on how the reviewer rates objects, but also on how other reviewers rate those objects and (2) The leniency of a reviewer and the quality of rated objects are mutually dependent. We develop the leniency-aware quality, or LQ model, which solves leniency and quality simultaneously. We introduce both an exact and a ranked solution to the model. Experiments on real-life and synthetic datasets show that LQ is more effective than comparable approaches. LQ is also shown to perform consistently better under different parameter settings.},

@article{Hofmeister2005,
abstract = {Software architecture design approaches typically treat architecture as an abstraction of the implemented system. However, doing so means that the concepts, languages, notations, and tools for architecture are much more closely related to those of detailed design and implementation than to those of software requirements. Thus the gap between requirements and architecture represents a paradigm shift, while that between architecture and detailed design does not. Global Analysis, which is part of the Siemens Four Views architecture design approach, is a set of activities that serves to reduce the magnitude of this gap by guiding the architecture design process, capturing design rationale, and supporting traceability between requirements and architecture. In this paper Global Analysis is re-examined in light of five years of teaching it, reflecting on it, comparing it to other approaches, and examining how it was applied in four new systems. This experience confirms the value of the Global Analysis activities and the importance of capturing its results. In some cases the benefit went beyond that envisioned, and in other cases Global Analysis was not applied as expected. Because the templates that are provided for Global Analysis results have such a strong influence on how the activities were performed, this will be the focus of future changes},

@book{Clear2015,
abstract = {Context: Global Software Engineering (GSE) has become the predominant form of software development for global companies and has given rise to a demand for students trained in GSE. In response, universities are developing courses and curricula around GSE and researchers have begun to disseminate studies of these new approaches. Problem: GSE differs from most other computer science fields, however, in that practice is inseparable from theory. As a result, educators looking to create GSE courses face a daunting task: integrating global practice into the local classroom. Aim: This study aims to ameliorate the very difficult task of teaching GSE by delineating the challenges and providing some recommendations for overcoming them. Method: To meet our aims we pose two research questions ("When teaching GSE to students in Higher Education, what are the (a) challenges, and (b) recommendations for addressing them") and then conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to determine the answers to these questions. Our SLR follows a carefully designed and validated protocol. Results: We found 82 papers that addressed our research questions. Our findings indicate that in addition to the challenges posed by GSE in general, particular problems arise in educational situations. The majority of these challenges fall into the "global distance" category, though teamwork challenges and people issues (such as trust) also commonly arise. Organizational differences between institutions, differing skill sets between students in different locations, and varying cultural work norms, for example, all operate within educational settings in quite different ways than in professional development teams. Integrating cultural training, conducting teamwork exercises to build trust, and instructor monitoring of team communication are all examples of techniques that have been used successfully by educators according to our review Conclusion: Despite the severity of the challenges in GSE education, many institutions have successfully developed courses and curricula targeting GSE. Indeed, for each of the challenges we have identified in the literature there are numerous recommendations for overcoming them. Instructors can use the recommendations given in this study as a starting point to running successful GSE courses.},

@article{McGrath2006,
abstract = {Established best practices in software development tend to assume that a product's intended stakeholders (i.e., users, customers, and clients) are fairly well known and generally accessible. This paper outlines specific issues faced by those who conduct requirements analysis in the context of open source projects in which the user communities are widely distributed. The examples described are drawn from the experience of managing tool development within the Sakai Project [1], a higher education effort to build and share a community source framework for supporting on-line collaboration in academic courses and projects. With a far-flung community of users and developers, this project requires new approaches to eliciting, analyzing, and prioritizing user needs. The issues outlined in this paper are currently being met by a preliminary set of solutions that makes use of web-based project management technologies. These technologies along with some planning and communication strategies help improve the decision-making process involved in deciding whether and how to choose among proposed constraints, use cases, and feature requests.

abstract = {We present a new constraint-based implicit active contour, which shares desirable properties of both parametric and implicit active contours. Like parametric approaches, their representation is compact and can be manipulated interactively. Like other implicit approaches, they can naturally adapt to non-simple topologies.Unlike implicit approaches using level-set methods, representation of the contour does not require a dense mesh. Instead, it is based on specified on-curve and off-curve constraints, which are interpolated using radial basis functions. These constraints are evolved according to specified forces drawn from the relevant literature of both parametric and implicit approaches.This new type of active contour is demonstrated through synthetic images, photographs, and medical images with both simple and non-simple topologies. For complex input, this approach produces results comparable to those of level set or parameterized finite-element active models, but with a compact analytic representation. As with other active contours they can also be used for tracking, especially for multiple objects that split or merge.},

abstract = {Location based social networks (LBSNs), such as Foursquare, allow users to post micro-reviews, or tips, about the visited places (venues) and to“like”previously posted reviews. Tips may help attracting future visitors, besides providing valu-able feedback to business owners. In particular, the number of “likes” a tip receives ultimately reflects its popularity or helpfulness among users. In that context, accurate predic-tions of which tips will attract more attention (i.e., “likes”) can drive the design of automatic tip filtering and recom-mendation schemes and the creation of more effective mar-keting strategies. Previous efforts to automatically assess the helpfulness of online reviews targeted mainly more ver-bose and formally structured reviews often exploiting tex-tual features. However, tips are typically much shorter and contain more informal content. Thus, we here propose and evaluate new regression and classification based models to predict the future popularity of tips. Our experimental eval-uation shows that a linear regression strategy, using features of both the user who posted the tip and the venue where it was posted as predictors, produces results that are at least as good as those produced by more sophisticated approaches and/or by using each set of features in isolation.},

abstract = {We study the effect of the volume of consumer reviews on the purchase likelihood (conversion rate) of users browsing a product page. We propose using the exponential learning curve model to study how conversion rates change with the number of reviews. We call the difference in conversion rate between having no reviews and an infinite number the value of reviews. We find that, on average, the conversion rate of a product can increase by as much as 270{\%} as it accumulates reviews, amongst the users that choose to display them. We also find diminishing marginal value as a product accumu-lates reviews, with the first five reviews driving the bulk of the aforementioned increase. To address the problem of si-multaneity of increase of reviews and conversion rate, we use customer sessions in which reviews were not displayed as a control for trends that would have happened regardless of the increase in the review volume. Using our framework, we further find that high priced items have a higher value for reviews than lower priced items. High priced items can see their conversion rate increase by as much as 380{\%} as they accumulate reviews compared to 190{\%} for low priced items.We infer that the existence of reviews provides valu-able signals to the customers, increasing their propensity to purchase. We also infer that users usually don't pay atten-tion to the entire set of reviews, especially if there are a lot of them, but instead they focus on the first few available. Our approach can be extended and applied in a variety of settings to gain further insights.},

abstract = {Context: One of the chief challenges of Global Software Development (GSD) is for globally, culturally and linguistically diverse team members to communicate effectively. Failing to meet this challenge can lead to misunderstandings that impede project success. To prepare practitioners for remote and diverse forms of communication we have developed VENTURE: a simulationbased training platform that aims to increase cultural awareness. Aim of study: Having developed a prototype training platform, we now assess whether VENTURE can deliver real learning and increase cultural awareness. Method: A survey was designed based on educational theory. Using a heuristic evaluation approach, a group of potential users trialed the system and completed a proof of learning survey before and after using the platform. Survey results, and VENTURE's own automated assessment scores, were analysed and compared. Results: Results indicate that the platform has the potential to provide useful and meaningful training for cultural awareness in GSD. A secondary result is that the assessment scheme proved useful in providing both evidence of learning and highlighting areas where VENTURE could be improved. Conclusion: Researchers and practitioners can gain an understanding of how to evaluate, train and measure soft skills, such as communication, important to all forms of software development. The methodology applied served to adapt the environment to the needs of potential users and the actual problems of GSD. Copyright 2014 ACM.},
